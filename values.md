I believe that the best way to understand someone is to understand their values. This page is an attempt to capture mine. What you read here is the result of a lot of introspection, and is a work in progress. The introspection was aided by a "values exercise" I found in [Bury My Heart In Conference Room B by Stan Slap](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/306470/bury-my-heart-at-conference-room-b-by-stan-slap/), and is an exercise I've been running for myself every year for the past 5 years.

## 5 values that most define me as a human being

- Impact
- Accomplishment
- Family
- Learning
- Determination

## 3 Values that I canâ€™t live without

### Family

What it gives me that makes it so important:

1. We celebrate each other
2. We support each other when things go wrong
3. We expect open and honest communication from each other
4. We understand and accommodate each others styles and preferences
5. Avoid ruinious empathy - we are willing to have difficult conversations with each other
6. Push each other to be the best versions of ourselves

### Impact

What it gives me that makes it so important:

1. To know that I am doing work that matters
2. The satisfaction from creating positive change in the world
3. A sense of growth and progression
4. A sense of success and accomplishment

### Learning

What it gives me that makes it so important:

1. Trying new things
2. Becoming better than I was yesterday
3. Intellectual stimulation
4. Security that I am better prepared for the future
5. Deriving wisdom and experiences from others - continuously expanding my worldview and the mental toolkit that I can draw from.

I am the most energized when my actions and behaviours are aligned with my values, or the values of the environment I am in (the people, the organization) are either compatible with my values or support my expression of these values.

I am the least energized when my actions and behaviours are in conflict with my values, either because I am operating from a place of fear, or because the environment I am in is not compatible with my values.
