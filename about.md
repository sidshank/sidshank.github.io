I'm Siddhartha (Sid) Shankar, and I am currently a Senior Engineering Manager at GitHub serving the CodeQL dynamic languages team, supporting JavaScript/TypeScript, Python and Ruby. I have had the privilege of leading and managing engineering teams since 2015. I'm at my best when engaging in opportunities that require bringing people together - often across teams - to deliver value to customers in a sustainable and pragmatic way. 

I grew up living in multiple cities across India. Primarily Bengaluru, New Delhi and Mumbai. I moved to the US in 2006 to pursue a Master's degree in Electrical Engineering - Control Systems at the [University of Michigan, Ann Arbor](https://umich.edu/).During my graduate program, my interests shifted towards software engineering, software-hardware interfaces, and programming languages. This led me to a full time role at [MathWorks](https://www.mathworks.com/).

I've spent a large part of my career working on [Stateflow](https://www.mathworks.com/products/stateflow.html) - a Model Based Design tool for Finite State Machine construction, simulation and code generation - at MathWorks, working on capabilities like the Stateflow debugger, state transition tables, message semantics and edit-time static analysis checks. I moved to Canada in 2018 to increase my exposure to (and skills with) distributed systems, while working at startups like [Wave Financial](https://www.waveapps.com/) and [Prodigy Education](https://www.prodigygame.com/).
