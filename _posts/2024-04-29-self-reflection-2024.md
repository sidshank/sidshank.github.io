I’m going through a self-reflection exercise today (It’s that time of the year at GitHub). What do I want coming out of this exercise? 

- An honest accounting of things I got done — The impact I had and influenced. This is mostly for me to acknowledge and record because I tend to forget these things easily.
- Reflection on what could have gone differently — Not in a way that involves hand-wringing, or expecting myself to have superhuman levels of cognition or capacity. Definitely in a way that makes me more self-aware, and gives me clues about how I can change my behaviours and patterns of interaction.
- Clarity about my journey over the next 6 - 12 months — What specific experiences do I want to have that will get me closer to where I want to be 3-5 years from now? For me, this is the most valuable part, that I hope will lead to the most interesting conversations with my manager.
