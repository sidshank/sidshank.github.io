May was "Mental Health Awareness Month". In consideration of my own mental health and to retain some degree of faith in humanity, I decided to kick to the curb my use of the misinformation laden hellscape that is now X. 

Having taken a similar step with Facebook a few years ago, this wasn't difficult. At least with Facebook, I still log in once a month or so to scroll the feed for a few minutes and catch up with posts in specific groups. With X, I decided to delete my account entirely. 

I don't need to see politicians and their legions of followers throwing shade at each other.
I don't need to read increasingly unhinged conspiracy theories.
I don't need to see random strangers arguing with each other, sticking firmly to their point of view, instead of trying to understand the other side.

I think the platform works for some, and if you can stay on it without letting the negativity affect you, have at it.

Adieu X, we hardly knew ye.
