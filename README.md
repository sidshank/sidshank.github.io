Hello World! I'm currently a Senior Engineering Manager at [GitHub](http://github.com/) on one of the [CodeQL](https://codeql.github.com/) static language teams supporting C# and Go. 

### Some things about me

- 🌆 I grew up living in multiple cities across India. Primarily Bengaluru, New Delhi and Mumbai.
- 🛫 🇺🇸 I moved to the US in 2006 to pursue a Master's degree in Electrical Engineering - Control Systems at the [University of Michigan, Ann Arbor](https://umich.edu/).
- 👨‍💻 During my graduate program, my interests shifted towards software engineering, software-hardware interfaces, and programming languages. This led me to a full time role at [MathWorks](https://www.mathworks.com/).
- 🛠️ I've spent a large part of my career working on [Stateflow](https://www.mathworks.com/products/stateflow.html) - a Model Based Design tool for Finite State Machine construction, simulation and code generation - at MathWorks, working on capabilities like the Stateflow debugger, state transition tables, message semantics and edit-time static analysis checks.
- 🚗 🇨🇦 I moved to Canada in 2018 to increase my exposure to (and skills with) distributed systems, while working at startups like [Wave Financial](https://www.waveapps.com/) and [Prodigy Education](https://www.prodigygame.com/) (pursuing risky startup opportunities in the US on a H1B visa would have been... risky?).
- 🧗‍♂️ I have had the privilege to lead and manage engineering teams since 2015. As a software engineer, one of my favourite parts of the job was helping to grow (and learn from) others around me, while continuously looking to improve the ways in which we worked - Engineering management has afforded me the opportunity to focus in these areas.
- 📚 I love reading books, although my reading habits center entirely on non-fiction at this point (the last fictional work I read was The Lord of The Rings 🧙, which remains my favourite book series!). Find me on [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6595276-sid-shankar).
- 🤓 I am broadly interested in organizational design, building psychologically safe environments, learning about high performing teams and systems design / thinking.
